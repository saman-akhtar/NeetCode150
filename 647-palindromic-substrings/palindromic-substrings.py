        #In summary:

# Maximum Palindrome Substring:
# Youâ€™re after a single value (the longest length) and its position. The LCS approach works well because a valid palindrome appears as a contiguous block that satisfies the alignment condition, and you just take the maximum.

# Counting Palindromic Substrings:
# You must enumerate every valid occurrenceâ€”even overlapping ones. The LCS method gives you blocks, but it doesnâ€™t naturally separate overlapping counts. This makes it non-intuitive and error-prone to adapt the LCS DP for counting.

# Thatâ€™s why the LCS-based method is more naturally suited for finding the longest palindromic substring, while counting all palindromic substrings is best done using a DP method or center expansion approach that directly deals with overlaps and enumerates every palindromic substring.

# better to use TWO pointer here
